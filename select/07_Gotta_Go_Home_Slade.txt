All dressed up in your Sunday best, you never know when to stop
You got a tight fit top. One with a belt, hoping that it won't drop off

Woah... when you gotta go home then you gotta go gotta go home
When you gotta go home then you gotta go gotta go home
When you gotta go home you gotta go

All dolled up in your birthday suit, you just gotta wear a smile
Your headlights flash talking about ya, never going out of style

Woah... when you gotta go home then you gotta go gotta go home
When you gotta go home then you gotta go gotta go home
When you gotta go home you gotta go

Always there with a new sensation - A new designer frock
Always there with a new creation - determined just to shock

All decked out in your masquerade and you and me are on the loose
You got a tight fittin' top, one with a belt on. Holding on it ain't no use

Woah... when you gotta go home then you gotta go gotta go home
When you gotta go home then you gotta go gotta go home
When you gotta go home then you gotta go gotta go home

When you gotta go home then you gotta go gotta go home
When you gotta go home then you gotta go gotta go home
When you gotta then go you gotta go

When you gotta go home then you gotta go gotta go home
You gotta go home I said you gotta go home
When you gotta go home then you gotta go gotta go home
When you gotta then go you gotta go

When you gotta go home then you gotta go gotta go home
When you gotta go home then you gotta go gotta go home
